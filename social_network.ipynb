    "\"Network effects\" is a generic name given to the effect that one user of a product has on the value of the product as perceived by others. If none of my friends are using Myspace anymore, then its value drops in my eyes, even though the product itself hasn't changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "We've seen a long succession of social networks rise and fall -- Bebo, Myspace, Facebook, Orkut, Twitter. They don't fade gradually -- instead, there is a kind of mass exodus, as people realise that all their friends are leaving. But there may be pockets of users who are densely connected to each other and all stay together. Because they are densely connected to each other (perhaps in a clique or near-clique), and less densely connected to other users, they don't perceive a huge drop in the product's value, and so they may stay a long time.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's interesting to use simulation methods, like the information flow model above, to study these effects in different types of graphs. Let's try to create a model.\n",

    "Let's simplify by assuming that users never switch back.\n",
