Pregel
======

This is a toy single-machine implementation of Pregel, Google's system
for running large-scale graph algorithms on a large cluster of
machines.

For an illustration of how to use this implementation of Pregel, see
the example code in pagerank.py.

For more information, see http://michaelnielsen.org/ddi/pregel/

This is forked from https://github.com/mnielsen/Pregel, and a few
additions have been made. A tutorial.ipynb Jupyter notebook has been
added.
